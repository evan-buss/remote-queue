    WAITING
        - In the game queue, waiting for a specific screen event to trigger

PROTOCOL MESSAGES
    Client -> Server:
        (maybe) - Join the Queue
            - This requires a lot more complexity than accepting a queue
        ACCEPT_GAME:
            - Click the ready button on computer
        DECLINE_GAME:
            - Don't do anything for the ACCEPT_WINDOW
        
    Server -> Client:
        GAME_READY:
            - Alert user that ACCEPT_WINDOW has started
            - Give the user a countdown timer
            - Show accept and decline buttons to the user
        QUEUE_FAILED:
            - Alert the user that not everyone accepted the queue
            - Hide the buttons
            - Client waits for GAME_READY again.



Game Class
    - CLICK_POS (x, y)
    - READY_COLOR (RGB) (x, y)
    - ACCEPT_WINDOW (time in seconds)
    - INTERVAL (time in second to poll the screen for changes)

    Events:
        - Loop at INTERVAL
        - Once the READY_COLOR has been seen, send a message to the client
        - Start internal accept window timer
        - User accepts:
            - Click the given CLICK_POS
            - If the user clicked, rut not everyone accepted in the window, restart
                - Not sure exactly how to determine this.
        - User doesn't accept within ACCEPT_WINDOW:
            - Leave the queue
            - Alert user
